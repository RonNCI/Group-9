Group 9 - JetBird
created by: Ronnel, Dev, Timofey, Fadi, Andrei



--Description--
This is the first look of JetBird. It is still in development, so the website is not very appealing yet. Our group has decided to focuse more on implementing on the back-end side. Then we will focus on the front-end side of JetBird and start adding styles
and themes to make it look more appealing to everyone. Currently, JetBird has a register, login, and a booking system. The register system will allow for all users to create a JetBird accound. The login system will allow the JetBird users to login into 
JetBird and gain access to the booking system. Everyone in the group has worked really hard up to this point, and as we progress more into developing JetBird, new functions will be available for the exisintg members to access.
